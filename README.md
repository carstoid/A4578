## Development Workflow

Run a local development server: from the `site-src` directory, `npx gatsby develop`.

Deploy to GitHub pages: from the `site-src` directory, run `npm run deploy`. This will create a new static build of the documentation site, copy in static pages from `presentations`, and automatically push changes to the `gh-pages` branch of the repository.
