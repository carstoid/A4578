# GIS Design Lab

## Learning Objectives

- technical skills for spatial data management, analysis, **presentation**
- conceptual issues in geographic thinking and research design, **use of mapping in design practice**
- practical examples and case studies (**precedents**)
- 2/3 skills-based exercises, lectures and readings
- 1/3 development of individual student projects
- provide **materials for independent learning** beyond scheduled class time (reading lists, precedents and additional/optional tutorials)

## Structure

- 2 hrs of lab time weekly following lecture
- class time split between  
  - lecture/precedent discussion (recap LM lectures, supplement with design-specific content)

### Part I – Skills Development

| Lecture | Lab |
| --- | --- |
| Introduction | **begin basic skill training** Introduction, Precedents, Review Mapping Data Assignment, Tobler's First Law and Corollary: "People close to problems are closer to solutions” (Aletha Maybank) |
| Spatial Data & Mapping Basics | Vector data in 3+ dimensions, Scale & availability, cartography and symbology |
| Projections & Coordinate Systems | Related concepts of projection (UV), surveying, perspective, orthographic projections. Assign & discuss Metahaven Surface excerpt |
| Vector-Based Analysis, Geoprocessing, MAUP |  |
| Raster-Based Analysis, Raster Math, Density, Interpolation & Remote Sensing | Discussion: Appropriateness of data formats (Couclelis) |
| Decision Support | **here-down: tutorial menu, diverge from planning sections** resources for self-directed learning. materials on "how to learn" link with research design - "what do I want to know?" |
| Q&A – Midterm Check-In | 3d modeling (rhino-grasshopper) |
| Spatial Statistics and Clustering | rendering/diagramming/illustration |
| University Election Holiday | presentation: indesign, aftereffects/premiere and the web |
| Networks | Preview & Precedent Review: Data Collection, Thick Mapping |
| Data Collection, Creation and Uncertainty |  |

### Part II – Projects

| Lecture | Lab |
| --- | --- |
| Participation, Privacy, Protection, and GIS |  |
| Future Directions: Research, WebGIS, Geolocative Services, and Ubiquitous Computing; GIS Infrastructures, Implications, and Ethics | "The Cartographer" vs collaborative mapping as a system.  |
| **Project Presentations** |  |
