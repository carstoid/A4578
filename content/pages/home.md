title: Course Overview
---

This is the course page for A4578-3 and 4, the required lab section for M. Arch, AAD and AUD students enrolled in A4577 [Geographic Information Systems](https://courseworks2.columbia.edu/courses/sis_course_id:PLANA4577_001_2019_3/assignments/syllabus).

In lab we will:

- learn and practice techniques for spatial data management, analysis and presentation
- discuss conceptual issues in geographic thinking and research design, with a focus on the use of mapping in design practice
- review practical examples, precedents and case studies

We will meet for two hours weekly, following lecture. Lab time will be split between reading discussion, supplemental lectures/demonstrations and exercise troubleshooting.

Outside of lab you'll be asked to work through a series of exercises, then develop a research project as part of a small group. With the help of other course instructors and TAs, I will provide support and feedback as you work, as well as additional materials and resources for independent learning beyond scheduled class time (reading lists, precedents and extra tutorials).

## Schedule

A condensed version of the class schedule is provided here for convenience. Please see the A4577 syllabus for full details.

## Exercise Submissions + Grading

There will be two deliverables for each exercise:

Exercise Questions. Answer all of the questions contained in the exercise, explaining how you got your answer. Record your answers in a simple table like the one below, saved as a CSV file. You can use this [template](/downloads/ccr2139_exercise1.csv) if it's helpful.

| Q | A |
|---|---|
|1.1| There are 5,280 feet in a mile. |
|1.2| Raster and vector. |
|...| ... |

Map. Use the techniques outlined in the exercise to produce a map of the world on a single 11x17 layout, saved as a PDF. See the note at the end of the exercise for detailed instructions.

Name all deliverables `yourUNI_exerciseN`, substituting your UNI, the current exercise number for N.

When you are finished with the exercise questions and map, place both files inside a ZIP archive named with the above convention (ex. `ccr2139_exercise1.zip`) and submit through canvas.

If your submissions are not formatted as requested they will be returned for resubmission.
