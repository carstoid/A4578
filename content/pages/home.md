title: Course Overview
---

This is the course page for A4578-3 and 4, the required lab section for M. Arch, AAD and AUD students enrolled in A4577 [Geographic Information Systems](https://courseworks2.columbia.edu/courses/sis_course_id:PLANA4577_001_2019_3/assignments/syllabus).

In lab we will:

- practice and develop technical skills for spatial data management, analysis and presentation
- discuss conceptual issues in geographic thinking and research design, with a focus on the use of mapping in design practice
- review practical examples, precedents and case studies

Outside of lab you'll be asked to work through a series of exercises, followed by the development of a research project. We will provide you with support and feedback as you work, as well as additional materials and resources for independent learning beyond scheduled class time (reading lists, precedents and extra tutorials).

## Schedule

We will meet for two hours weekly, following lecture. Lab time will be split between reading discussion, supplemental lectures/demonstrations and exercise troubleshooting.

Roughly the first half of the semester will have an intensive focus on skills development, after which we'll shift gears to begin work on your research projects. Later in the semester some lab time will be set aside for desk crits.

## Assignment Submissions

Grading for our lab assignments will be considered in two parts. For each exercise you will be asked to submit both a series of maps and quantitative and/or short written responses.
