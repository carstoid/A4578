## Part 1 | Reading Response: A Map

Importantly, as we begin creating data-driven maps and other spatial data visualizations, a necessary step is to become critical readers of maps—consistently evaluating their arguments and the ways in which those arguments are supported or undermined by their (re) presentation. Just like written text, the efficacy of a map’s communication is determined by the graphic language used, its clarity, its hierarchy and visual syntax, and so on.

As such, the first deliverable of the Mapping Data exercise is a brief reading response assignment commenting and critiquing on a map of your choice.
Select a map. This map can be printed or digital, made for any purpose, and of any age. It must be a static (not animated, not interactive), two-dimensional, planimetric map. If your map is printed, you will have to acquire a scanned image of it. Think about the topics and questions below before choosing your map. (Of course, if it is not designed in such a way for you to discuss its composition in the terms outlined below, then it is probably not a good choice for this assignment.)

Claim your map! Each student should select a different map to discuss—on a first come, first served basis. To claim your map, comment on the Discussion Thread called “Mapping Data: Part 1.” In that comment, embed an image of the map, and include the map’s bibliographic citation. Check that no one else has already claimed your map. If you are ready to write
your Reading Response, you can add the text to this comment. If not, reply to your original comment with the text of your Reading Response when you are ready to submit.
Your reading response should be no more than 250 words. Consider some of the following questions when thinking about the map. Please note that the reading response should not simply answer these questions nor should it describe the map. Instead, please focus your response around your critical and careful reading of the map, supported with description where necessary. (In other words, these questions are to help you choose and evaluate the map.)

1. Is it a reference, analytical, or thematic map? How do you know?
2. Who is its intended audience? How do you know this? Is it implied in the design of the map (be specific)?
3. What are the scale and extents of the map? Does its framing seem appropriate and effective for its intended purpose? How so?
4. Does the map display quantitative or qualitative information? If quantitative, consider whether and how the data is classified. If qualitative, consider whether and how the data is categorized. Is the reasoning behind these choices clear to the reader? Is the map designed to be read as authoritative, interpreted, experiential, generalizable, activist, ...? (And how can you tell?)
5. What other information is present (titles, descriptive text, infographics, data sources)? How do these contribute to communicating the overall narrative, argument, or purpose of the map?

### Extra Credit

For extra credit, you can (now or throughout the semester) post additional responses or critiques following the same guidelines and directions listed above to the Discussion Thread titled “Mapping Data: Extra Credit Maps.” For credit, you will need to post an image of the map, its full bibliographic citation, as well as a <250-word critique.
