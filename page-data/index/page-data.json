We will provide you with support and feedback as you work, as well as additional materials and resources for independent learning beyond scheduled class time (reading lists, precedents and extra tutorials).</p>\n<h2>Schedule</h2>\n<p>We will meet for two hours weekly, following lecture. Lab time will be split between reading discussion, supplemental lectures/demonstrations and exercise troubleshooting.</p>\n<p>Roughly the first half of the semester will have an intensive focus on skills development, after which we'll shift gears to begin work on your research projects. Later in the semester some lab time will be set aside for desk crits.</p>\n<h3>Basic Skills</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Week</th>\n<th>Lecture</th>\n<th>Lab</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>9/7</td>\n<td>Introduction.
