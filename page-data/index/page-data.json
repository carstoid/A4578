Arch, AAD and AUD students enrolled in Leah Meisterlin's A4577 <a href=\"https://courseworks2.columbia.edu/courses/106786\">Geographic Information Systems</a>.</p>\n<p>In lab we will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>learn and practice techniques for spatial data management, analysis and presentation</li>\n<li>discuss conceptual issues in geographic thinking and research design, with a focus on the use of mapping in design practice</li>\n<li>review practical examples, precedents and case studies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will meet for two hours weekly, following lecture. Lab time will be split between reading discussion, supplemental lectures/demonstrations and exercise troubleshooting.</p>\n<p>Outside of lab you'll be asked to work through a series of exercises, then develop a research project as part of a small group. With the help of other course instructors and TAs, I will provide support and feedback as you work, as well as additional materials and resources for independent learning beyond scheduled class time (reading lists, precedents and extra tutorials).</p>\n<h2>Schedule</h2>\n<p>A condensed version of the class schedule is provided here for convenience.
